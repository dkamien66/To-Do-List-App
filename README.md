# To-Do-List-App
# What
This project is a To-Do List App that lets a user add an item to the list, remove the last item from the list, and clear the list.

# Why
I was in a SuccessWorks Coding Skills Path Program at UW-Madison (https://successworks.wisc.edu/skill-paths-program/) for 4 weeks over the summer. As I learned web development languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I applied my learned skills into this interactive application.
